# DSA: Two Sum

### Problem
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may not use the same element twice.

### Requirements
- Must be implemented in JavaScript
- Time complexity should be better than O(nÂ²)
- Proper error handling

### Example
```js
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  
Output: [0, 1]
```

### How to Run
```bash
node twoSum.js
```
